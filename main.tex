    Wow brother, definitely an intense read but how could it not be! The dark and brutal reality of what is happening right in your face and still people will continue to ignore it. I was 16 when 9/11 occurred and I was there at the march against the Iraq war, the biggest political protest ever in the UK, totally ignored. The script was signed sealed and delivered. We were going to invade a country that was implicated in no way with the atrocities of 9/11. It took me a few more years to wake up to the real goings on of these events but I felt an overwhelming feeling of futility after that. I was disengaged from the political sphere completely and became a voluntaryist/anarchist I suppose. Reading your book made me remember all those feelings of rage, confusion, disbelief etc. From that time feel every bit of what you are feeling now. I think your writing is fantastic. Engaging, emotive, not for the faint-hearted, powerful and tragic. I fear that those who need to read it the most will hide away from it, just like they will hide away from their monstrous reflections. I for one will not hide away from that monster and strive to do more and speak out more on this issue. Most people lack the self-awareness and perspicacity to do so and will continue their NPC ways, repeating things other people have said to them as if it were their own opinion. "Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation".

\chapter{Background}

The \textit{Munroe Doctrine} and \textbf{P5 nation} monopoly on violence, with an asymmetric and unassailable, advantage of \textbf{nuclear arms} \textit{stockpiles}, and/or previous hot wars they instigated, supported or funded by the P5 nations, with veto power on the United Nations Security Council which makes the international governing body, and new world order - the United Nations - or world government, completely toothless.
The \textbf{United Nations} has \emph{no authority}, 
enforceability, or
global monopoly of violence, 
to enforce any of the doctrines of the \textit{Geneva Convention} \cite{toft2005john, unitednations2023twitter, pictet1952geneva}.
\\\\
Because the P5 nations will ignore and veto, 
\textit{international law}, the 
\textit{Geneva Convention}, and 
humanitarian aid law, and 
historic \textit{WWI}, and \textit{WWII}
\textit{peace deals}, \textit{treaties}, and \textit{non-aggression} pacts between \textbf{Ã¼bermensch} P5 nations, 
and extremist non-state and state minority actors, who are rogue nations, who \textbf{fucking hate} the \textit{Team America World Police}  \cite{unitednations2023twitter, nietzsche1888thus, parker2005team}.
\\\\
\textbf{'Murica} and her citizens, are so Autistic, stupid, ignorant, and brainwashed by their military-industrial complex, they forget, globally, if you were to run a survey or poll, of American foreign policy, abroad and overseas, over 60\% of the global population and international community, fucking hates you guys, and that includes many \textbf{WEIRD} 
(i.e. because psychological data are dominated by samples drawn from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) nations, and overwhelmingly, the United States \cite{muthukrishna2020beyondweird}.
\\\\
\textbf{\textit{TLDR;}} for \cite{muthukrishna2020beyondweird}, the Americans are so brainwashed, and out of touch, with the collective global world experience, they have permanently broken and already fucked the field of psychology!

\chapter{Execute Order 66}

Today, while minding my own business, documenting war crimes and their advocacy from strangers on the internet. Closer to home, I found out all my "fake friends", of whom I truly disliked, from college, were genocide sympathisers. 
I think I had an intuition to begin with, that they were morally bankrupt, malicious and wretched human beings, without human decency, love or compassion

\epigraph{"You underestimate the power, of the Dark Side"}{-- Darth Vader}

Please remember that voluntarily, unprovoked, and under no coercion, you responded in such a pathetic and cowardly way, that you outed yourselves as genocide + apartheid sympathizers/advocates. You doxxed yourself as Nazis.

\chapter{United Nations}

I thought I had too many friends on Facebook anyway, you never reached out, or asked how I was doing, or attended my mother's funeral in March 2023, despite all being invited...

I'm glad that in (accidentally) outing the genocide sympathizes, who I genuinely thought when I shared my honest thoughts on the humanitarian crisis, active Hamas and Israel war crimes, violation of international law, unilateral and strong condemnation from the international community in the "real" United Nations, that an old Facebook messenger chat from when we played 
    "fake" dress-up cosplay United Nations, 
might have an interest in global conflicts, humanitarian crises, and active war crimes, in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.

Not only are you 
    "fake friends", 
but you are 
    "fake global citizens". 
You do not care for the plight of the innocent 2.2 million Palestinian civilians being slaughtered by the Israel IDF. 

The 
    "Real" 
United Nations had a summit yesterday in Cairo, Egypt (BBC 2023) - where they condemned both Israel and Hamas, unequivocally and unilaterally for committing genocide. An ethnic cleansing via       
    "collective punishment" 
and maximized 
    "collateral damage". 
The Cairo United Nations summit on Israel-Palestine unanimously condemned the carnage and unacceptable civilian casualties. 
\\\\
Please picture in your head 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Babies,
    \item women, 
    \item elderly, 
    \item churches, 
    \item ambulances, 
    \item hospitals, 
    \item humanitarian aid NGO volunteers, 
    \item bakeries, and 
    \item the West Bank. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Now, take a break. \\ 
And process that information.
\\\\
Take a deep breath. \\
In through your nose, \\ 
and out through your mouth. 
\\\\
8 seconds in, \\
8 seconds pause, \\ 
8 seconds out. 
\\\\
Now picture them, again:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Babies,
    \item women, 
    \item elderly, 
    \item churches, 
    \item ambulances, 
    \item hospitals, 
    \item humanitarian aid NGO volunteers, 
    \item bakeries, and 
    \item the West Bank. 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Humanitarian Aid}

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PCRS) \cite{prcs2023palestine} is an NGO. Officially founded in 1968, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) is an officially recognized independent Palestinian National Society. It caters to the health and welfare of the Palestinian people and others in need. These are volunteer humanitarian aid workers providing medical treatment to wounded babies, children, women, and the elderly. Because all the military-age males don't live long, in Palestine have been turned into human shrapnel.

Since 1948, Israel's IDF has committed genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian civilian population, via collective punishment and maximized collateral damage, through the indiscriminate bombing of the civilian populations. Sanctioned, funded, supported, and paid for by the United States, NATO, and the military-industrial complex, that of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Blackstone, and BlackRock. 
\\\\
Remember

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lockheed Martin builds the drone
    \item Raytheon makes the missile
    \item Israel's IDF makes Gaza and the West Bank rubble, and 
    \item Blackstone and BlackRock rebuild the rubble.
    \item[] Repeat, see steps 1-4
\end{enumerate}

Then the whole cycle starts again 
    "fresh". Lockheed build, 
Raytheon make bombs, Israel's IDF uses them, Blackstone and Blackrock rebuild the rubble as if the generational trauma of genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian civilian population was never there,
\\\\ 
Remember

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lockheed Martin 
    \item Raytheon
    \item Israel's IDF
    \item Blackstone and BlackRock
    \item[] \textbf{Ethnic cleanse}, rinse and repeat, \textit{ad infinitum, ad naseam}!
\end{enumerate}

Not one innocent civilian was spared from the Israel IDF's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza and the West Bank. The Cairo summit commented that  
\emph{"collective punishment"} 
as unacceptable and not a 
    \emph{"proportionate response"} 
to the October 7th Hamas attacks, and urged for an 
    \emph{"immediate permanent ceasefire".}

The only people who were silent, were the United States, NATO, and the other members of the Military Industrial Complex that are complicit in funding, and providing lethal aid for Israel to defend itself. But the IDF just used their 

\epigraph{"Arsenal of Democracy"}{-- Joe Biden \cite{pbs2023biden}}

, to commit genocide and \textbf{ethnic cleansing} via \textit{collective punishment} and \textit{maximized collateral damage}, through the \textit{indiscriminate} bombing of the civilian populations.

I am profoundly disappointed that the \textit{"fake friends"} I used to play dress-up Model United Nations Memes with, are utterly propagandized, uninformed, asleep, and not woke to truly evil and vile suffering, the Palestinian civilian population has been under, since 1948, Gaza and the West Bank, is a
\begin{quote}
    \emph{"LIVING HELL ON EARTH!"}
\end{quote}
An open-air prison apartheid state, with a blockade of humanitarian aid, no water, gas or electricity, infrastructure, community, or sense of security or sovereignty, due to the brutal Israeli occupation. The Israel IDF, under BB Netanyahu's command, Biden's unwavering support and lethal aid, and NATO's monopoly on violence in the international community, have been bombed back to the stone age, in 2023 since 1948.
\\
Maybe it's a good thing we were playing "pretend", a Model United Nations because I don't think my "fake friend", "fake global citizen", propagandized genocide and apartheid sympathizers have zero epistemic humility or epistemic voluntarism. I don't think you were cut out for real-world geopolitics with such a sheltered, "fragile" worldview.

\chapter{October 7th - the day of}

I too was in your very same position. Just last week. I saw the horrific, wholly unjustified, and unequivocally, barbaric and abhorrent October 7th Hamas Attack. The equivalent of x50 World Trade Center 911 attacks for the Jewish state of Israel, when compared per capita. Being too young to have experienced the horrors of 911.
\\
I was angry, distressed, upset, gobsmacked, stunned and alarmed. I felt unsafe and thought an international conflict between Palestine-Lebanon-Iran-Russia and Israel-United States-NATO, was sure to break out. A third world war. World War III. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction was out the window when US citizens were kidnapped as hostages and killed by Hamas. Article 5 of the NATO alliance, was the expected response to dead American tourists. 
\\
I was furious, I was angry, I was out for blood. 

\epigraph{
I will destroy Hamas
}{-- Jesse Wood \cite{wood2023destroy}}

I screamed at the top of my lungs and publicly declared on social media. I condemned Hamas unequivocally and put them "on blast" for resorting to a day of Islamic Militant Religious Extremism Jihad. A blood bath of babies, children, women and the elderly.
\\\\
On October 9th, 2023 I posted this:

\\\\
Brave or foolish? You pick. I find my self-critical self, clinically diagnosed depressed and anxious self, wavers from 
\begin{quote}
    "brave" and "foolish" 
\end{quote}
like an oscillating pendulum. 
\begin{quote}
    "Why do I choose to make my life so much more difficult?", 
\end{quote}  
I whisper,
\begin{quote}
    "Why don't I just shut up, and remain silent, like the rest of the crowd?", 
\end{quote}
I say,
\begin{quote}    
    "WHY CANT I JUST BE NORMAL?", 
\end{quote}
I shout, 
 \begin{quote}   
    "WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT FORIEGN WARS HALF WAY ACROSS THE GLOBE?", 
\end{quote}
I SCREAM at the TOP of my lungs!
You tell sweet nothings, and platitude, in your small talk, busy Non-Playable Character (NPC) lives:
\begin{quote}
    "It doesn't affect your life", 
\end{quote}    
they say,
\begin{quote}
    "It won't impact you in any way", 
\end{quote}  
they say,
\begin{quote}
    "it's too dangerous to speak publicly", 
\end{quote}    
they say.

I wish I could be normal, just like the rest of you, I truly do. 
But I have this voice inside me, like the Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio, 
which is a metaphor in that fairy tale for a 
"conÂ·science" - a person's moral sense of right and wrong, 
viewed as acting as a guide to one's behaviour.
Or, in layman's terms, a \emph{"moral compass"}. 
That moral compass talks to me, and steers my focus, attention, and passion:
\begin{quote}
    "That is unfair", 
\end{quote}
Jiminy whispers,
\begin{quote}
    "That is unjust", 
\end{quote}
the cricket talks,
\begin{quote}
    "That is oPPreSSioN", 
\end{quote}
Jiminy shouts,
\begin{quote}
    "THAT IS VIOLENCE AGAINST THE INNOCENT", 
\end{quote}    
the cricket begins to scream,
\begin{quote}
    "THAT IS PURE, UNADULTERATED EVIL!", 
 \end{quote}   
Jiminy belches, louder once more.
\begin{quote}
    "THAT IS WRETCHED EVIL, AN ATROCITY, AND INHUMANE!!!!",
\end{quote}
The cricket SCREAMS, at the top of his lungs. I feel my heart pounding, a panic attack, and my chest is internally bruised from the intense sense of urgency, depression and RAGE, that injustice invokes in me. 

I'm asking in good faith, am I the only person in this country that little cricket talks to? Am I the only one, who lends "conscience" my ear?
\begin{quote}
    "Does this happen to everyone?"
\end{quote}
I ask in good faith.
\begin{quote}
    "Do you have a panic attack induced by anxiety when there is injustice in the world?"
\end{quote}
I suspect I won't like your answer.
And at the risk of sounding cliche, I AM BATMAN!
An orphan, with two dead mothers, and an unrelenting crusade for justice and humane decency, on this wicked and cruel pale blue stone.

\end{quote}
I ask,
\begin{quote}
    "How do you bottle that FURIOUS RAGE up, and continue your WEIRD lives?"
\end{quote}
WEIRD is an acronym \cite{muthukrishna2020beyondweird} - which stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD).
\begin{quote}
    "Do you know how lucky we are, not to be born into abject poverty, in the third-world, like the majority of the global population, and fight for survival, and to live, every single day, just to live?"
    \\
    "If you are reading this in New Zealand, you are in the top 1\% of affluent people globally, you are the ultra-rich, the liberal elites, the out-of-touch with reality, the privileged?"
    \\
    "When was the last couldnt afford the loan from BlackRock/Blackstone to rebuild your house, because the war profiteers at Lockhead Martin \& Raytheon, bombed it for the fourth time, again?"
\end{quote}

Don't forget our four war profiteers:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lockheed Martin 
    \item Raytheon
    \item Israel's IDF
    \item Blackstone and BlackRock
    \item[] \textbf{Ethnic cleanse}, rinse and repeat, \textit{ad infinitum, ad naseam}!

    "HOW CAN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THEIR IS INJUSTICE IN THE WORLD!" \\
    "OUR CHURCHES, HOSPITALS, AMBULANCES, BAKERIES ARE BURNING!", 
\end{quote}
    
the cricket sobs between breaths,
\begin{quote}
    "THE W... WO... WOR... WORL... WORLD... WORLD IS ON \\

     BURNING WITH THE WA... WA... WAR CRIMES OF  \\

\end{quote}
     
I reply, sobbing uncontrollably.
\begin{quote}
    "HOW DO YOU ALL DROWN OUT THAT LITTLE CRICKET WHEN HE SCREAMS AT YOU?",
\end{quote}
I utter to my disbelief.

Millions of lives have since 1948 with Israel, or 3,000 years ago, in 500 AD, if we consider the historic persecution of the Jewish people by the then Egyptian King, who drove them out of their homeland. Moses was an actual historical figure, who led the Israelites into the desert, to seek Asylum from the Pharoh's wrath. Moses didn't actually part the Red Sea, it happens naturally, when two tidal streams part, in different directions. That Pharoh started this whole bloody millennia-long blood path, over the contested holy lands of Jerusalem.

Three different religious groups interpreted religious scripture and teaching differently, and now they hate each other so much, they will commit genocide, and carnage, on their respective enemies' innocent youth.

\chapter{October 8th - the day after}

Israel was out for blood too. Hamas was pure evil that deserved to be wiped off of the face of the planet. Eradicated. the October 7th Hamas attacks, destroyed my (already dwindling) faith in humanity.

In October 21, 2023, I hurled the indictment below, see \cite{wood2023baddiesisrael}:

\begin{quote}
    \> Iran and Putin think you're too hardcore.
    \\ 
    \> Putin still wages war in Ukraine, but thinks you should have a ceasefire. 
    \\ 
    \> Ethnic cleansing of the (mostly) child civilian population of Palestine.
    \\ 
    \> Bombed 20 hospitals historically, but maybe didn't bomb another the other day.
    \\ 
    \> Bombs hospitals so often you have a hotline to tell the doctors you're going bombing again.
    \\
    \> Blocking civilian aid to Palestinian civilian population.
    \\
    \> Commits warcrimes by using white phosphorus on civilians.
    \\
    \> Bombs the West Bank in a war with Hamas, even though Hamas have no influence in the West Bank.
    \\
    \> Your elected leader and prime minister posts vlogs of his IDF bombing civilians to keep us updated on his life journey.
    \\
    \> NGOs and humanitarian spokespeople don't like Netanyahu's 48 hour evacuation order, calling it human.
    \\
    \> Bombing babies in civilian Indiscriminately, maximizing collateral damage.
    \\
    \> Bombing the last bakery in Gaza as if it was a strategic military target.
    \\
    \> Has an Iron Dome state-of-the-art missile defence system, but uses it to bomb children, women, elderly and bakeries, offensively.
    \\
    \> Has a dark collective historic and emotional memory of ethnic cleansing under the Nazi German holocaust in the 1930s, but enough Alzheimer's and moral relativism, to commit an ethnic cleansing today on Palestine.

Whoops, wait what, you may have tripped up there towards the end. I did too. Why am I talking about Palestine, and not the ethnic Jew's in Israel, and the brutal October 7th Hamas attack. Because in the 13 days between that Hamas attack, and my post. I woke up. I saw something. I heard that little voice, Jiminey cricket, my conscious. 

He whispered in my ear,
\begin{quote}
    "Something is not right here!?" \\
    "Israel has killed more civilians than Hamas on October 7th." \\
    "Why are there all these videos of dead, injured, brutally mutilated babies?" \\
    "And why are those dead babies now Jews?" \\
    "Why are all those dead babies, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals, churches, bakeries, women and children, all from Palestine?"
    \\\\
    "1... 1,... 1,0.... 1,00... 1,000... 1,000 dead Palestinian children, hold up, that can't be right, check it again!". \\
    "Shit! Confirmed by third-party spectators in the international community." \\
    "United Nations summit in Cairo, Egypt. This should be interesting. Maybe they will clear up what other things Hamas did, to provoke such an extreme Israeli counter-strike." \\
    "This summit is good, it appears to be balanced, and they are talking about both sides. Good, oh shit. No, they are condemning Israel for their 'proportionate response'."
    \\\\
    "Israel is not Hamas! \\ 
    they are better than that, they wouldn't commit genocide. \\
    There is no apartheid. \\ 
    That's a left-wing conspiracy theory from self-hating Jews."
\end{quote}
That cricket chirped, his curiosity piqued.
\begin{quote}
    "Israel is not Hamas?",
\end{quote}
he asked playfully,
\begin{quote}    
    "Yeah, they are better than that.
    \\
    They don't butcher babies."
\end{quote}
Jiminy retorted,
\begin{quote}
    "You want to tell that to the 1,000 children they turned into dust and ash molecules with drone strikes in the past two weeks?"
\end{quote}
He jibed, playful, but clearly a little annoyed.
\begin{quote}
    "israel is not hamas ..."
\end{quote} 
I repeat, with a lack of certainty, and conviction.
\begin{quote}
    "Israel is not Hamas!"
\end{quote}    
I say lowder, but with less confidence.
\begin{quote}
    "ISRAEL IS NOT HAMAS!!!"
\end{quote}    
I scream, but my brain has been struck by lightning, my heart is pounding, my chest hurts.
My brain is on fire, I feel my head, pulsing with my heartbeat.
I need to sit down, and catch my balance, and regain my bearings.
\begin{quote}
    "Israel is not Hamas?"
\end{quote}    
I probe pensively, asking the cricket for his opinion, for once.
\begin{quote}
    "Why are you looking at me? You know the answer!
    \\
     The Israel IDF is serving drone-strike fried babies, women and elderly, in a restaurant of rubble.
    \\
     Are you hungry, do you want some more, do you want seconds? 
    \\
     Is this enough dead babies for you? 
    \\
     Or are you going to be hungry, for another genocide later?"
\end{quote}     
Jiminy Cricket scolds, he is clearly not impressed. But hasn't given up.
Instead he changes tact, 
\begin{quote}
    "What is the most evil, vile, scummy and villainous, act that you can conjure?"
\end{quote}
I reply dismissively,
\begin{quote}
    "I can't think right now, it's all just charcoal corpses of unrecognisably human-burnt babies.
    \\
     Just give me a second, I need to catch my breath.
    \\
     It's hard to not think of something, when you are actively telling yourself not to think about it."
\end{quote}     
I am hyper-ventilating, my chest is bruised again, from another anxiety-induced panic attack.
The cricket resumes his interrogation:
\begin{quote}
     "What is evil?"
\end{quote}    
He says. Loud, stern, but in good faith, seemingly expecting the right answer, from me.
\begin{quote}
     "I dunno, it's hard to think right now.
    \\
      That image, the charcoal, the fresh blanket, the charred and unrecognisable corpse.
    \\
      It is hard to answer you, and your moral philosophy questions when I'm having a panic attack.
    \\
      That image is etched in my brain, perminantly, it's like I started at the sun for too long, or the living room light bulb.
    \\
      I feel nauseous, I feel uneasy, very unsettled."
\end{quote}      
I stop hyper-ventilating, regain my composure.
\begin{quote}
     "You know why you are having a panic attack?
    \\
      Because your world is on fire, and you need to act now.
    \\
      If you don't escape, the structural fire will collapse the building.
    \\
      And 110 stories of a skyscraper, is going to flatten you, like a pancake.
    \\
      It's an emergency, but there's no one here to help, you can't just dial 911.
    \\
      No one is listening, they are a sleep, and wont answer your cries for help.
    \\
      You have to get out of this one yourself.
\end{quote}      
Surveying the surroundings, I try to assess the situation, but its burning dumpster fire of aborted fetuses. It smells like wrank bacon and burnt plastic.
The residue of of my explosive revelation, or moral epiiphany, that was about to hit me, right bang, smack, in the face, was not apparent to me.
Then it dawned on me,
\begin{quote}
     "F... Fu.... Fuc... Fuck.... Fuck. Fuck!
    \\
      The baby, the baby, the dead baby wrapped in a freshly washed blanket.
    \\
      Being craddled, by her catanonic mother, singing an incoherant nursery rhyme, because she is experiecning extreme pyschological trauma.
    \\
      That is it! That is the thing! That is pure evil. 
    \\
      That is satan, the adversary, a betrayel of human decency.
\end{quote}     
The cricket, begins to smile, 
\begin{quote}
      "Yes. And?"
\end{quote}      
I'm confused, I think for a bit, I thought I got the answer right. I didn't know it was a multiple questiont test.
I thought it was a riddle, with a right answer, that was hard to find.

\chapter{Epiphony}

My views on the Israel-Palestine conflict have shifted drastically because I was presented with new evidence. This is the reason why epistemic humility and voluntarism, are important, to being a rational and objective critical thinker. We must learn to update our beliefs when they don't match objective reality. Should we not, we become delusional, idealogues, puppets, or stenographers for the global war machine. The "proportionate response" of Israel's IDF, to the October 7th Hamas Attack, quickly became out of control. 

There is one first-hand personal experience from a Palestinian civilian mother I would like to share with you, in the hopes, that if you are willing and open to new evidence, you can change your mind, and update your beliefs when presented with new evidence. This is an incredibly graphic, distressing, and psychologically traumatic first-hand account of a Palestinian innocent civilian plight, that will rock your world! And shake your foundation beliefs, and preconceived notions of Palestine, Hamas, Israel and the IDF to their "fragile" core.

I opened the X app, formerly Twitter, to be greeted with a video. From a citizen journalist in Gaza. That day, the Israel IDF had just bombed the bakery. They just bombed the last standing bakery, the last one in Gaza, as if that was a strategic military target, Palestinians seeking refuge in an open-air prison state can't have muffins because "Hamas guys bad". On that same day, a less-than-a-year-old baby was caught in the crossfire of the Israel IDF's indiscriminate bombing of densely populated civilian areas. A perverse gift of a child wrapped in a package called "collective punishment", executed with the 

\epigraph{
    Arsenal of Democracy
}{-- Joe Biden \cite{pbs2023biden}}

which is just a friendly pseudonym for

\epigraph{
    tools of ethnic cleansing of (mostly child) innocent civilian population
}{-- Jesse Wood}

, that United States President Joe Biden, coined in his address to the nation, on Friday, 20th October\cite{pbs2023biden}.

The video whose graphic contents, I should warn you in advance, may leave your stomach churning, and give you a migraine, are as follows. I warned you!
\\\\
In a city of rubble, indistinguishable from Armageddon, or the 9th circle of Hell, the deepest and worst described in Dante's Inferno \cite{dante1861inferno}. A mother, whose face is pale ghostly white, is catatonic, and incoherently rambling a butchered lullaby. She rocks her child back in forth in a fresh clean white blanket. All seems fine in Gaza, a moment of peace in a war zone. But there is just one problem. The blanket is freshly washed and clean, and still smells like the lake, the local lake the mother hand-washed her child's blanket in because Israel's IDF had cut off the power, water and gas. She was used to low-tech living, and pretending it was the Stone Age again, for here this was no bother, or inconvenience at all. No one has automatic washer-dryers, in Gaza. No one has electricity. No one has a home, that isn't just a pile of rubble or about to be. But that didn't bother this mother, she was used to that. She had grown up in a war zone and experienced it her entire life. It is probably for the best she can't see the warm insulated "healthy home", in New Zealand, or some other WEIRD country \cite{muthukrishna2020beyondweird}, you are reading this from. It would be as if she was abducted by aliens, with advanced technology, and enough creature comforts, that her life would be twenty times easier.
\\\\
The war, the rubble, no power, no gas, no electricity. You see none of this was really the problem. What really bothered her, but she was catatonic and in too much of a psychologically traumatic state to be aware of, consciously process, or understand, was something much worse. Wrapped warmly and with love in that freshly washed white blanket, was the charred black corpse of a dead baby, that had been cooked by the Israel IDF's indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations. The baby was burnt so badly, that its species was nearly unrecognisable. It could have been an orangutan or another great ape, it was impossible to tell, from the ashes of baby, your baby, your baby boy or girl, burnt alive in a world on fire. That mother's world is indistinguishable from Dante's 9th circle of hell, I mentioned earlier (Alighier 1861). Do you know what that final circle of hell is reserved for? Who could be so evil they deserve the worst punishment, in the place, where the bad people go. "Treachery", the mortal sin of betrayal. As Judas betrayed Jesus, Caine betrayed Abel, Scar betrayed Mufasa, Jafar betrayed Aladdin, and Anakin Skywalker betrayed Padme and Obi-Wan Kenobi. There lurks one more traitor in our midst. 

\begin{quote}
    "Can you smell their stench?" \\
    "Can you guess their betrayal?" \\
    "Can you feel the icy cool chill from the winds of their evil?" \\
    "Can you see that hell has frozen over?" 
\end{quote}

The suspense and tension, has been built, and reached its crescendo.

\begin{quote}
    "Who is it?", 
\end{quote}

you ask. 
\\\\
As a giant Lovecraftian Shoggoth, it becomes visible at a distance and lurks in your peripheral vision. It's growing louder. It's approaching. It's coming towards you. It is heading straight for you. You know, it has detected you. This hell-scathed demon-spawn from oblivion stands, 6 feet away from you. Making direct, unbroken, eye contact. You don't recognize its form whatsoever. But you know it is evil, and you know if you are in the 9th circle, it must be treacherous, too. Satan, punishes traitors, by re-living performative contradictions, hypocrisy and cowardice, that lead to their betrayal. A take some of your own medicine, approach. After the most uncomfortable, 30-second staring competition with the star-spawn of nightmares, it finally dawns on you, what this treacherous being is.

\begin{quote} 
   "You should really take a pride in your appearance", 
\end{quote}

a stranger called Jiminy Cricket, says introducing himself to you, his voice manifesting from inside your soul.

\begin{quote}
  "But, w... wh... wha... what.. \\
  What about the monster? RIGHT?" 
\end{quote}

You reply, the cricket laughs hysterically,

\begin{quote}
  "What about the monster?", 
\end{quote}

he parrots,

\begin{quote}
  "It's you! Silly billy", 
\end{quote}

Jiminy adds,

\begin{quote}  
  "It's your ugly reflection! You big dumb goof" 
\end{quote}

The cricket concludes, trying to be constructive, but resolute, in his claim.

\begin{quote}
  "Stop hiding from you own shadow, and come out into the real world!"
\end{quote}

Jiminy finishes,

\begin{quote}
    "that reflection of you, that treachery, is because you turned you back on humanity. \\
    You were silent, while the world was on fire, and our children were burning. \\
    You said nothing, you ran, you hid, like a coward.
    \\\\
    That is not what a protagonist, or hero, or main character would do, in your shoes. \\
    You ran an hid, like a little, girl. \\
    But you are an adult now, all grown up, it's time you start acting like it.
    \\\\
    Now don't think this lecture means I don't still love you. We will always be friends. \\
    I am not angry at you, I'm just dissapointed. \\
    We all make mistakes, some times, god, I would know. \\
    You should hear some of the stories, my name use to a noun and verb, for being reckless.
    \\\\
    But we fail. We live we learn. \\
    When we fall down, we don't just sit there and cry. \\
    When we fall down, we get back up, and try again. \\
    I know you are hurting, I know you are confused, and angry.
    \\\\
    I see you. I see your pain. \\
    But now, is not the time, for anger and hatred. \\
    The world is on fire, and it must be extinguished. \\
    But how are we ever going to do that, if your hatred keeps pouring gasoline on that fire? \\
    Your anger is like pouring jet fuel on the steel beams of the world. \\
    You think the entire world would collapse, an Armageddon, the apocalypse, the Rapture, the end of days! \\
    But you know what, never forget, jet fuel can't melt steel beams.
    \\\\
    The world will always be there, alive and well, ready to rebuild. \\
    And build we must, we must build back, stronger and better than before. \\
    From the smothering ashes of the rubble of humanity, rises the Phoenix of hope, for a better future, and a new day.
    \\\\
    I could never hate you, I could never be mad at you, silly. \\
    I am your conscience, and you are stuck with me, and I'm stuck with you, for life. \\
    But if we are going to be stuck with each other for several decades.
    \\\\
     Can I ask you one favour?"
\end{quote}

The cricket asks, with a big smile, grinning from ear to ear.

\begin{quote}
    "Go on, sure. What?"
\end{quote}

you say,

\begin{quote}
   "Can you please not ignore me, when the world is on fire, and you hear my screams?"
\end{quote}

The cricket politely asks.

\begin{quote}
    "Why would I ever do that?"
\end{quote}

You ask back, to Jiminy.

\begin{quote}
    "Because, you know I get lonely. \\
     The world is on fire, and I scream at the top of my lungs, \\
     But it's as if the world is asleep, no one can hear me. \\
     I thought I was alone in this world, too, you know?"
\end{quote}

The cricket is embarrassed, with rosy red cheeks.

\begin{quote}
    "You are not alone, now. I'll always be with you.  \\
     And, guess what? I'm happy to listen.  \\
     Whenever you say stuff, it is like the weight of the world, is taken off of my shoulders. \\
     I like it when you talk."
\end{quote}

Jiminy smirks, then says the following quip, 

\begin{quote}
     "Because when you listen to me, you are awake, you are aware, and that's all it takes, to put out that world on fire!"
 \end{quote}   

\chapter{911 was a national tragedy}

2,977 American innocent civilians were killed in the towers, their collapse, and the structural fire, that ensued shortly after that collapse. In fact, a large portion of those lives lost, were the brave first responders, going back into burning buildings, that were not structurally sound, or safe, to try and rescue civilians trapped in the rubble.

America had a "proportionate response" to 911 in 2001 too. A horrific, mistaken, misguided, unprovoked, unjustified Iraq War. This war was fought over false pretences, lies to the UN Security Council, lies to the American population and manufactured consent (Chomsky 1991). 

Turns out, they got the wrong guy, there was no WMD, and they were fighting a foreign war in the wrong country. It was on public record that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Al-Qaeda Leader Osama Bin Laden, didn't only just not collaborate or plan the attack together. There was undisputed evidence of public hatred of each other, in drawn-out spats, and conflicts, in the public sphere. So, wrong country, wrong guy, unjust \& unprovoked war, and not actually an enemy of the United States before they committed a genocide of an estimated 150,000 - 300,000 innocent Iraqis in the civilian population. It would be the understatement of the century, to say, that George Bush, Neo-cons, and the United States war machine, "dropped the ball on this one".

Then the introduction of the Patriot Act, another unjustified response, stripped the Western world of their individual freedoms and human right to privacy, through mass surveillance of the civilian population that continues till this very day! Permanent Record by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden \cite{snowden2019permanent}, look it up, read it, or watch the movie, and you might learn something.

\\\\
Violence is a horrific, wholly unjustified, morally evil, but "natural" response to the oppression of an open-air prison apartheid state. I unequivocally condemn violence and Jihad. 
\\\\
And before you keyboard warrior SJW types and/or Netanyahu simps say it, the naturalistic fallacy implies that "just because something happens naturally, does not mean it is right. What is, is not what by default, what ought to be."
\\\\
But so long as Israel oppresses the Palestinian population in Gaza and the West Bank, there will be bloodshed and carnage.

\chapter{Op-Ed}

\textit{Israel has time to online bully climate activists with autism disorder, but not to answer for their war crimes}

Political story opinion editorial
By Jesse Wood

\epigraph{âThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.â 
}{â Edmund Burke}

Israel has time to online bully climate activists with autism disorder, but not to answer for their war crimes.
\\\\
But refusing to answer for their war crimes, violations of international law, or ethnic cleansing of Palestinian civilians via collective punishment and maximized collateral damage.
\\\\
See: \url{https://x.com/jrhwood/status/1715900453932933385}
\\\\
Yesterday, I called them out very publicly on this, and they remained silent. They chose to neither refute nor justify my accusations of war crimes. The comment in X (formerly Twitter) received a tremendous amount of attention and support through organic online engagement.
\\\\
See: \url{https://x.com/payette_lake/status/1715685481953083749}
\\\\
Then there were reports it was not being shown properly and failed to load in the X browser client and on Apple IOS. This is not an accusation of censorship, but I have yet to receive a response from X.com support, although I reached out to them both publicly, and via direct message.
I am truly sickened by Israel's flagrant violation of international law, blatant war crimes, and genocide, or ethnic cleansing, of the 2.2 million strong Palestinian civilian population with collective punishment and maximized collateral damage.
\\\\
See: \url{https://x.com/PalestineRCS/status/1714956642314338699}
\\\\
Israel is not Hamas. They aren't Islamic Jihadists. Now, it is time for them to start acting like it. They need to immediately cease bombing babies, women, children, the elderly, churches, bakeries, humanitarian volunteer aid workers, and the West Bank.

\epigraph{âThe line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained.â
}{Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918â1956}

It is completely unacceptable, and unequivocally evil and villainous. And they deserve the heavy condemnation they received from the international community at the United Nations summit in Cairo, which said just that. Even Putin, who is currently raging a war in Ukraine, and the Ayatollah, who are an Islamic Republic, think Israel is too hardcore for them. Hypocrisy, and a performative contradiction yes, but a lie? No!
\\\\
Genocide and Ethnic cleansing, of the Palestinian civilian population with collective punishment and maximized collateral damage, is a pure evil genocide of the innocent, they carried out to justify an open-air prison apartheid state in Gaza and the West Bank.

\chapter{From "Femi-Nazi" to "real-world" Nazi }

My ex-girlfriend's lived experience, and journey of personal growth, in the rubble of the "third-wave feminism" movement.

\begin{quote}
    "\textit{How the} \textbf{fuck} \textit{did that happen}?"
\end{quote}

We revel in our victory. But... Schadenfreude, is a subtle, but, ugly shade of hate. That joy is called Schadenfreude, and it stains the victor's soul with hate, too! You know? 
\\\\
This chapter analyses the information warfare pipeline, for manufacturing consent for genocide, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This chapter will include a thorough, objective, balanced, and good faith, analysis of the "woke" water slide, that takes you from "Fema-Nazi", to an actual, \emph{on god, no cap}, "real-world" Nazi!
\\\\
A brief summary, of the main thesis, is given below. That subject matter includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Logical inconsistencies and internal contradictions of third-wave feminism.
    \item Slippery when wet - an InforWar pipeline that constructs the water slide from social justice warrior to genocide sympathizer.
    \item Woke waterslide to Nazi Orwellian hell-scapes 
    \item Unfortunately with Daemomic ideological demagogue possession, there is no going back, just "Fema-Nazi".
    \item Hegelian dialectic, synthesis, anti-thesis, and synthesis, of intersectionality, Diversity Inclusion and Equity (DIE), and "corporate" wokeism.
    \item I joked you were a "Fema-Nazi" in college, and you laughed. But the reason it was a funny joke, was because I was just telling the truth.
    \item Accountability - Nuremberg trials for war criminals and their advocates. This document is a permanent record of your genocide sympathizing.
    \item Moving forward, and moving on - Truth and Reconciliation hearings, living with Nazis, learning to love them again, despite their pure evil, moral bankruptcy, and Nazism.
    \item Schadenfreude - "I told you so. I was right, back then, wasn't I?", don't revel in your victory, you have a right to be proud. Pat yourself on the back (no, seriously)
    \item Shame, Shame, Shame, (DING DING DING!!!). But don't openly or publicly shame Nazis with our defeat of Germany. The best way to beat a Nazi, it to be better... And not become one!
    \item The Jedi Knights - An analogy, and metaphor on moral virtue, in film. "It's over Anakin, I have the high ground?"
    \item Don't punch a Nazi, be better, be humble, be honest, but never forget!
\end{enumerate}
